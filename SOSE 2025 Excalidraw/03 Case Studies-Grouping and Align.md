## Test Case 01: Initialization of Group type

|         Category | first Initialization of type `groups`                                                         |

### Notes
#### `src/actions/actionGroup.ts`
- provides the logic to to compose unsser interaction between canvas/interactiveCanvas and client 'actions'
- should export all methods used:
- 

`src/actions/types.ts`
- looks to add the group and ungroup AppState variable
- 

`src/actions/appState.ts`
- editingGroupId and selectedGroupIds is inculded into state

`src/groups.ts`
- file dedicated to the grouping,
- ==holds core logic for groups, Definitely something there.==

### Todos
- [x] compare across local project any changes made since to the relevant files see relevant changes to
	- Conclusion: Excalidraw recently changed to a monorepo with some of their auxillary packaging joined into their parent repo. Core logic still the same but placed elsewhere.

## Test Case 03: Clean up of align group and distribute

### Notes:
- This test case evaluates the implemntation of the featured action Align
	- will do one more on distribute but I think it will be of similar type

#### `src/actions/actionAlign.tsx`
```typescript title:@line(21-24) info:4
const enableActionGroup = (
	elements: readonly ExcalidrawElement[],
	appState:AppState,
) => getSelectedElements(getNonDeletedElements(elements), appState).length >1;
```
- so you must first enable an action with a boolean value
- ActionGroup is different than selecting an elements in a group
	- group has multiple meanings in this codebase it seems.
	- ==could technically be at this point where the condition must also account for when in a selected group state==
- will also have to check when:
	- user has a group, double-clicks, does `getNonDeletedElements(elements)` return the elements in the app?
- looks as if the methods for various alignments i.e.: `actionAlignTop` `actionAlignBottom` etc... ~~are of type: `Alignment`, inherently.~~
	- of these methods `register()` is called, so it registers an action, determining what condition
- this holds the react logic for translating the alignment action

#### `src/actions/index.ts`
- index is where the methods are exported most likely imported in the main `App.ts`

#### `src/actions/types.ts`
- this is where types are defined

#### `src/align.ts`
- the Type for Alignment holds a `position` and `axis` value

```typescript title:"@line(12-14) Alignment Type" 
export interface Alignment {
  position: "start" | "center" | "end";
  axis: "x" | "y";
}
```

- ==will have to look into groups to determine if "group" has a different semantic meaning the the group I am interested in.==
```typescript title:"@line(40-57) getMaximumGroups()"
export const getMaximumGroups = (
  elements: ExcalidrawElement[],
): ExcalidrawElement[][] => {
  const groups: Map<String, ExcalidrawElement[]> = new Map<
    String,
    ExcalidrawElement[]
  >();

  elements.forEach((element: ExcalidrawElement) => {
    const groupId =
      element.groupIds.length === 0
        ? element.id
        : element.groupIds[element.groupIds.length - 1];

    const currentGroupMembers = groups.get(groupId) || [];

    groups.set(groupId, [...currentGroupMembers, element]);
  });

  return Array.from(groups.values());
};
```

- `calculateTranslation()` seems to be the core logic for elements that qualify, probably not of interest,

#### `src/tests/align.test.tsx`
- simple structure, most likely will reference this again as we will need to generate tests in this file
- just follow the same format



## Base line assumptions
- So it seems the project structure changed recently, files are all still there but their location may be diffferent, probably best to ensure that we are in the `packages/excalidraw` folder, as most of it is the source code for the repository.

### ~~`actionAlign.tsx`~~
- [p] predicate may not be where the issue lies although could optionally check whether or not

- relevant AppState?.properties:
- `editingGroupId`: default set to null,
	- predicate could have an additional condition for align such as:
	- ==...appState.editingGroupId != null && selectedElements.length > 1==
	- below could be all that is required ‚¨áÔ∏è in `../actionAlign.tsx`

```tsx title:"packages/excalidraw/actions/actionAlign.tsx" info:9
export const alignActionsPredicate = (
	appState: UIAppState,
	app: AppClassProperties,
) => {
	const selectedElements = app.scene.getSelectedElements(appState);
	return (
		selectedElements.length > 1 &&
		// TODO enable aligning frames when implemented properly
		(!selectedElements.some((el) => isFrameLikeElement(el)) || appState.editingGroupId !== null)
	);
};
```

We could probably test the same in regards to `../actionDistribute.tsx` too

```tsx title:"../actionDistribute.tsx"
const enableActionGroup = (appState: AppState, app: AppClassProperties) => {
  const selectedElements = app.scene.getSelectedElements(appState);
  return (
    selectedElements.length > 1 &&
    // TODO enable distributing frames when implemented properly
    (!selectedElements.some((el) => isFrameLikeElement(el)) || appState.editingGroupId !== null)
  );
};

```
